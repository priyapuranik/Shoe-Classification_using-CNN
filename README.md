# Shoe Classification using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

## Overview

**This project aims to classify different types of shoes using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The model is trained on a dataset of shoe images and is designed to accurately identify various shoe categories.** <br>

**--The model classifies images of three types of footwear: boots, sandals, and slippers.**<br>

**--Achieved an overall accuracy of 91% on the test set.**<br>

## Precision, recall, and F1-scores for each class are as follows: <br>

**a)Boots (0): Precision = 97%, Recall = 97%, F1-Score = 97%.** <br>

**b)Sandals (1): Precision = 86%, Recall = 92%, F1-Score = 89%.** <br>

**c)Slippers (2): Precision = 90%, Recall = 79%, F1-Score = 84%.** <br>

**The model was trained and tested on a dataset of 156 images, with balanced precision and recall for most classes.**<br>

***The purpose of this project is to develop a deep learning model capable of classifying different types of footwear, which can be used in e-commerce platforms or retail applications to automatically tag and categorize footwear images.***
