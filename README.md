# CNN_Shoe_Classification

## Overview

This project aims to classify different types of shoes using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The model is trained on a dataset of shoe images and is designed to accurately identify various shoe categories.

**The model classifies images of three types of footwear: boots, sandals, and slippers.**
**Achieved an overall accuracy of 91% on the test set.**
<b>Precision, recall, and F1-scores for each class are as follows:</b>
*Boots (0): Precision = 97%, Recall = 97%, F1-Score = 97%.*
*Sandals (1): Precision = 86%, Recall = 92%, F1-Score = 89%.*
*Slippers (2): Precision = 90%, Recall = 79%, F1-Score = 84%.*
**The model was trained and tested on a dataset of 156 images, with balanced precision and recall for most classes.**
